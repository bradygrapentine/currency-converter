    - Ensure that invalid data is not converted. If the input cannot be interpreted as a number, do not convert that input. Do you want to allow negative numbers?

    - Change the style of the input field to indicate when the number is invalid, perhaps change the input's color to red, or put a border around it?

    - Allow the user to choose a new base currency other than USD.

    - Allow the user to use a specific day in the past.

        HINT
